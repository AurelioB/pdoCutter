/**
 * @desc Feel free to name this file any way you like, as long as the .specs extension
 * remains intact. You may add as many specs files to the test folder as you wish.
 * They will all be picked up by the Extendables test runner.
 *
 * A specs file is a regular Javascript file, so use any Javascript code you wish.
 * Learn more about how to write tests at http://pivotal.github.com/jasmine/ and
 * also peruse http://stdbrouw.github.com/Extendables/docs/packages/testing/doc/readme.html
 * 
 * Don't worry about importing the ``describe``, ``it``, ``expect`` et cetera: the 
 * test runner will make these available for any specs, so you don't have to 
 * import any of them yourself.
