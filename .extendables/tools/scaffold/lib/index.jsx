/**
 * @desc This is a new module scaffold. Replace this description with a 
 * short summary of what this module does.
 * 
 * You can make anything from within this module available to scripts
 * by adding it to the ``exports`` variable, e.g.
 *     
 *    // in this module: 
 *    exports.MyClass = function MyClass () { }
 * 
 *    // in your scripts:
 *    var MyClass = require("thismodule").MyClass;
 *
 * All modules have access to two global variables, outside of what
 * ExtendScript offers by itself: ``exports`` and ``module``, which
 * contains the module id and its path.
 *
 * __core__.jsx serves as the main module. You may add other files in this directory.
 * They will be available as submodules, and can be accessed using e.g.
 * ``require("thismodule/submod")``
 *
 * Note that modules may require other modules as well as submodules, 
 * so avoid using #include wherever possible.
 *
 * If you're unsure as to how to proceed, check Extendables' built-in modules.
 * Those modules will give you a better feel for how things work.
